## Overview of Project <br>

The purpose of this project is an exploration of bacteria culture data with JavaScript, Plotly, Bootstrap, D3.js, HTML, and CSS. The data contains a population of 153 subjects/volunteers, and samples (bacteria cultures) from their bellybuttons. Creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the bacteria species from bacteria living on subject’s belly button for potential synthesis aimed at a beef-like taste for meat-less alternative.  Each test subject was given an ID number and may use their ID number from a dropdown menu to see a variety of data:
	* All Bacteria Cultures Found per Sample.
* Top Ten Bacteria Cultures Found per Sample.
* Demographic Information
* Belly Button Wash Frequency (Scrubs per Week)

The demographic information is directly under the pulldown tab to select the test subject id number. A foot note was added to the demographic info “WFREQ is used in the gauge to the right”. The gauge chart displays the belly button washing frequency value. <br>
